                      Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is a digital advertising
                      model where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is
                      clicked. PPC advertising can benefit your business by
                      driving targeted traffic to your website, increasing brand
                      visibility, and generating leads and conversions with
                      measurable results.

                      Dropshipping is a retail method where a store doesn't keep
                      the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a product is
                      sold, it's purchased from a third party and ship directly
                      to the customer. As a dropshipping service provider, we
                      assist in setting up and managing this process, allowing
                      businesses to focus on marketing and growth.
